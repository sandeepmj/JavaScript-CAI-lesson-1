# <h1>JavaScript Lesson 1: Introduction</h1>

<h3>Hello JavaScript Console </h3>

<p>Visit <a href="http://www.this-page-intentionally-left-blank.org/">this blank page.</a></p>

<p>Open the browser's JavaScript console by using <strong>command</strong>-<strong>option</strong>-<strong>J</strong> (&#8984; &#8997; J). Ideally you are using Chrome or Firefox.</p>

<p>Type: document.write("hello world!");</p>

<p>If you see "Hello World!" appear in your browser, congrats! Your just wrote your first bit of JavaScript.</p>

<p><img src="/img/mag-glass.jpg">Why the semi-colon? Because semi-colons separate JavaScript statements. If unsure, just use it.</p>

<p><img src="/img/mag-glass.jpg"> If it didn't work, make sure all quote marks are straight quotes rather than curly quotes</p>

<h3>Adding HTML using JavaScript:</h3>

<p>Type: document.write("You make $1000 per month but your expenses are $1100 per month.");</p>

<p>You can copy and paste part of this, but type: document.write("You make $1000 per month but your expenses are $1100 per month. You need to earn more or spend less!");</p>

<p>But it just comes out as one paragraph. Let's add some HTML:</p>

<p>Type: document.write("<h2>Your Budget Analysis</h2><p>You make $1000 per month but your expenses are $1100 per month. You need to earn more or spend less!</p>");</p>
